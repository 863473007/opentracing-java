# OpenTracing API for Java

This library is a Java implementation of Open Tracing API.

## Objectives

Distributed tracing and context propagation have become important analysis
tools for today's multi-layer distributed systems comprised of numerous
micro-services implemented in different languages.  The success of these
tools is dependent on pervasive instrumentation of applications and
libraries with trace context propagation support.

The OpenTracing project (http://opentracing.io) provides a multi-lingual
standard for application-level instrumentation that's loosely coupled to any
particular downstream tracing or monitoring system. In this way, adding or
switching tracing implementations becomes an O(1) code change.

## Status

This project is currently skeletal, and unreleased.

This project will be released once it provides an API and standard
implementation that can be used by instrumentation libraries to collect and
propagate distributed tracing context. Finally, it will include a
[Zipkin](http://openzipkin.github.io)-compatible Tracer.

# Development

This is a maven project, and provides a wrapper, `./mvnw` to pin a consistent
version. For example, `./mvnw clean install`.

This wrapper was generated by `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper -Dmaven=3.3.9`

## Building

Execute `./mvnw clean install` to build, run tests, and create jars.
