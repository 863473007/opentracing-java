# OpenTracing API for Java

This library is a Java implementation of OpenTracing API.

## Objectives

Distributed tracing and context propagation have become important analysis
tools for today's multi-layer distributed systems comprised of numerous
micro-services implemented in different languages.  The success of these
tools is dependent on pervasive instrumentation of applications and
libraries with trace context propagation support.

The OpenTracing project (http://opentracing.io) provides a multi-lingual
standard for application-level instrumentation that's loosely coupled to any
particular downstream tracing or monitoring system. In this way, adding or
switching tracing implementations becomes an O(1) code change.

## Status

This project has a working design of interfaces for the OpenTracing API. It does
not have a test harness or any implementation, yet.

Packages are not yet deployed to Maven Central, but work is in progress.

# Development

This is a maven project, and provides a wrapper, `./mvnw` to pin a consistent
version. For example, `./mvnw clean install`.

This wrapper was generated by `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper -Dmaven=3.3.9`

## Building

Execute `./mvnw clean install` to build, run tests, and create jars.
