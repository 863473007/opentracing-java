# OpenTracing API for Java

This library is a Java platform API for OpenTracing.

## Required Reading

In order to understand the Java platform API, one must first be familiar with
the [OpenTracing project](http://opentracing.io) and
[terminology](http://opentracing.io/spec/) more generally.

## Status

This project has a working design of interfaces for the OpenTracing API. It does
not have a test harness or any implementation, yet.

Packages are not yet deployed to Maven Central, but work is in progress.

# Development

This is a maven project, and provides a wrapper, `./mvnw` to pin a consistent
version. For example, `./mvnw clean install`.

This wrapper was generated by `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper -Dmaven=3.3.9`

## Building

Execute `./mvnw clean install` to build, run tests, and create jars.
